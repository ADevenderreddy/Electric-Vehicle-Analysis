# Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard - Power BI
## Project Overview
This project provides an in-depth analysis of electric vehicles (EVs) using Power BI, focusing on key metrics such as total vehicle count, average range, production trends, and the breakdown of vehicles by different makers and types (BEV and PHEV). The dashboard is designed to offer clear, actionable insights for stakeholders in the electric vehicle industry, helping to track industry trends and performance.<br>

**Key Insights**
**Total Vehicles**: The dashboard shows the overall count of electric vehicles in the dataset, giving a broad view of the EV landscape.

**Average Range**: Insight into the average driving range of the vehicles, helping to understand the advancements in battery technology and efficiency.

**Total Vehicles by Makers**: Breakdown of the number of vehicles produced by different manufacturers, highlighting market leaders and competitors.

**Total Vehicles Produced by Year**: A time-series analysis showing the number of EVs produced annually, identifying production trends and growth patterns.

**BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle)**: Separate visualization for BEVs, showcasing the count and distribution of fully electric vehicles.

**PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle)**: Similar visualization for PHEVs, which use both electric power and internal combustion engines.

## Tools Used
**Power BI**: For data visualization and insights generation.
